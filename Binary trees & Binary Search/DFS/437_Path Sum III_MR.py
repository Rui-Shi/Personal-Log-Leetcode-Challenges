# Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum.

# The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.
# Example 2:

# Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
# Output: 3
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].
# -109 <= Node.val <= 109
# -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000
