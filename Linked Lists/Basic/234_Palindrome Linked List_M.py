# Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a 
# palindrome
#  or false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,2,1]
# Output: true
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: false
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
 

# Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
