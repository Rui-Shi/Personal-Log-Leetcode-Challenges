# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

# Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49
# Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [1,1]
# Output: 1

# the width of the container will decrease, and the height cannot increase (because it's limited by the shorter line).  
# Therefore, moving the taller pointer can only result in a smaller or equal area.  By moving the shorter pointer, 
# we have a chance of finding a taller line that might increase the area.
