    "# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP, is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of \"objects.\" Instead of thinking about a program as a series of sequential procedures, OOP organizes code to model real-world things. For example, you can model a car, a user, or a bank account as an object in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefits of using OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Organization:** It bundles related data and functionality together, making code easier to understand and manage.\n",
    "* **Reusability:** Inheritance allows you to reuse code from existing classes to create new ones, saving time and effort.\n",
    "* **Maintainability:** OOP makes it easier to debug and modify code, as changes to one object are less likely to break other parts of the program.\n",
    "* **Scalability:** It provides a clear structure for building large and complex applications."

    "## Classes and Objects: The Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The two fundamental concepts in OOP are classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class:** A class is a **blueprint** for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have. For example, a `Car` class could define that all cars have a `make`, `model`, and a method to `start_engine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object (or Instance):** An object is a specific **instance** created from a class. If `Car` is the blueprint, then a specific Ford Mustang or a specific Tesla Model S would be objects of the `Car` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Creating a Simple Class and Object\n",
    "\n",
